# PhysicsEditor-Cocos2dx-3.2-Box2d-Generic-parser
Update to the PhysicsEditor Loader by CodeAndWeb to support Cocos2d-x 3.2 and higher. Their current build has deprecated warnings, so basically swapped dictionary and array for ValueMap and ValueVector. If you don't know what this does, it basically loads the plist file generated from PhysicsEditor Program.
